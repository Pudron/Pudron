				<h1>My Story</h1>
				<p>Because of my school work,I can not develop many useful libraries for Pudron temporarily.But I will
				do it in the future.<br/>I 'm just a senior high school student.Having learned computer programming by myself for
				 six years,without any professional guidance,I experienced a tortuous way.Pudron is not perfert,which is the huge potential
				  I think.In the future, after receiving professional guidance, I will let the potential of Pudron explode.
				  I've worked hard and sacrificed a lot to develop pudron.But the beauty in the distance makes me never give up.
				  Pudron also let me remember: I love programming, I have worked hard for it, I still have a lot to learn and a lot of room for development. I hope I can open up from this space
				  I also hope that my efforts can make more people gain.</p>
				<div class="secret">
					I wonder why my hope is always broken by something awful.I really hope for the happiness.
