## Reasons for development
When I was learning computer programming,I found many programming languages have a high threshold.There many big concepts for beginners.
And their format is a little hard to understand.When developing a simple function, a lot of tedious code is needed.So I developed this programming language to minimize the entry threshold
and make programming easier.
